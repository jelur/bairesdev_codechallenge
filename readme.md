# IQVIA Apollo Gemini Front End Developer UI Test

Author: Jesus Lugo (@jelur)

## Notes
- Building tool (codekit) was set to use _autoprefixer_.
- HTML5 **Dialog** wasn't used for the popup, because it still short on browser compatibility.
- Overal popup _scale_ is altered because Zeplin project wasn't fully available, and taking the image on a retina-display computer delivers a high resolution image (which was scaled down to 1/2 size, but now seems like too small)

## Tooling
- Sublime Text
- CodeKit
- Firefox for Developers

## About Fonts

Main font seems to be *Proxima Nova*, however isn't a free font. close alternatives to it are *Raleway*, *Montserrat* or *Lato* (available at Google Fonts service). The version chosen for this implementation was taken from https://github.com/elliakou/proxima-nova-web-fonts, please remember that the idea was to match the original font as close as possible, licensing issues could prevent this implementation to be final.
