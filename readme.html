<ul>
<li>Building tool (codekit) was set to use <em>autoprefixer</em>.</li>
<li>HTML5 <strong>Dialog</strong> wasn&#8217;t used for the popup, because it still short on browser compatibility.</li>
<li>Overal popup <em>scale</em> is altered because Zeplin project wasn&#8217;t fully available, and taking the image on a retina-display computer delivers a high resolution image (which was scaled down to 1/2 size, but now seems like too small)</li>
</ul>

<p>Main font seems to be <em>Proxima Nova</em>, however isn&#8217;t a free font. close alternatives to it are <em>Raleway</em>, <em>Montserrat</em> or <em>Lato</em> (available at Google Fonts service). The version chosen for this implementation was taken from https://github.com/elliakou/proxima-nova-web-fonts, please remember that the idea was to match the original font as close as possible, licensing issues could prevent this implementation to be final.</p>
