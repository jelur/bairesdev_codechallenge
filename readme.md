## About Fonts

Main font seems to be *Proxima Nova*, however isn't a free font. close alternatives to it are *Raleway*, *Montserrat* or *Lato* (available at Google Fonts service). The version chosen for this implementation was taken from https://github.com/elliakou/proxima-nova-web-fonts, please remember that the idea was to match the original font as close as possible, licensing issues could prevent this implementation to be final.
